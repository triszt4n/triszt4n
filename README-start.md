# Hi there 👋

My name's Trisztán Piller, I'm from Hungary. I'm currently working on my Computer Engineering BSc at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, specialising in Software Development. 🎓

I love exploring the latest web and app development technologies (mainly backend), and I have a deep interest in cloud based development, especially in the serverless microservice architecture. ☁️
